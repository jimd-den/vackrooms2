//! Pure architectural domain types for procedurally *planned* levels.
//!
//! These describe a region-scale building plan — who designed it
//! ([`ArchitectGenome`]), what each space is for ([`SpaceProgram`]), how
//! circulation feeds spaces ([`CirculationSpine`]), and how spaces are
//! assembled ([`AssemblyInstance`]) — before anything is voxelized. The
//! planner (`use_cases::region_plan`) fills these in; the level generator
//! samples them per voxel column. Nothing here knows about voxels, chunks,
//! rendering, or WASM.
//!
//! All types are small, plain data. Determinism comes from how they are
//! *derived* (seed + region coordinate), not from anything stored here.
