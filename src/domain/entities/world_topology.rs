//! Pure domain language for the infinite macro-scale world graph.
//!
//! The world is not a heap of independent regions: it is an unbounded,
//! lazily evaluated *graph* whose vertices are architectural places and whose
//! edges are portals and vertical links. This module holds only that
//! language — plain data with stable identities — so every layer above it
//! (macro planner, region planner, voxelizer) can agree on what the world
//! *is* without agreeing on how it is rendered.
//!
//! Scale hierarchy (each level constrains the one below it):
//!
//! ```text
//! world seed
//!   -> MacroFields        multi-octave parameter fields (this file: data)
//!     -> MacroCell        160 u graph cell: nodes, portals, vertical links
//!       -> RegionPlan     80 u architectural plan (entities::architecture)
//!         -> ColumnPlan   one voxel column (use_cases::level_zero)
//! ```
//!
//! Determinism contract: everything here is derived from
//! `(seed, lattice coordinate)` by the planner in
//! `use_cases::world_topology`; nothing stored in these types may depend on
//! query order, chunk size, or LOD. Neighboring macro cells must compute
//! *identical* shared portals from their own side of an edge.
