//! Bake finite-range voxel irradiance from the scene's emissive geometry.
//!
//! This use case deliberately separates four physically meaningful stages:
//!
//! 1. erase the previous bake;
//! 2. inject emission through exposed downward faces of ceiling fixtures;
//! 3. find shortest unobstructed paths through air in world-space units;
//! 4. project that air irradiance onto the first solid surface it reaches.
//!
//! Solids are receivers, never propagation nodes. A wall can therefore be lit
//! on its near side without becoming a light source for the room behind it.
//! The working calculation is floating point; quantization happens only when
//! the result is written back to the grid's established RGB 0--15 contract.
//! This field is deliberately an approximate, finite-range diffuse fill. The
//! renderer's analytic area lights remain authoritative for direct lighting;
//! this bake neither invents omnidirectional emitters nor requires unbounded
//! cross-chunk propagation halos.
