//! The pluggable level-generator port: each Backrooms "level" (Level 0
//! offices, Level 34-B grassland, ...) is one implementation.
//!
//! Contract for implementors:
//! * **Seamless tiling** — derive ALL geometry from *world-space* coordinates
//!   (chunk origin + local voxel index), never from chunk-local positions, so
//!   independently generated chunks line up at their borders.
//! * **Walkability** — the ground plane must stay connected: never fully
//!   enclose a region the player could be in. Doorways/gaps must be at least
//!   ~1 world unit wide.
//! * **Determinism** — same (chunk_pos, seed, config) must always produce the
//!   same grid; only the injected [`NoiseProvider`] may be used for variety.
//! * Lighting is NOT the generator's job: place `VOXEL_LIGHT` sources and the
//!   orchestrating use case runs the exposed-face lighting bake afterwards.
