//! Shared WebGL2 infrastructure for every GPU driver.
//!
//! Before this module existed, the three GL drivers each carried private
//! copies of program linking, GPU timer queries, matrix math, shadow-map
//! target setup, and light selection. One definition of each now lives
//! here; the drivers keep only what is genuinely theirs (their resources
//! and their draw order).
