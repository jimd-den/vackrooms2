//! Peripheral Shift: "whenever not directly observed, the layout can warp,
//! stretch, or rearrange itself" — the one non-Euclidean mechanic the game
//! has today, and the template for any future level's own version of "the
//! space doesn't stay put." A child module of `engine`; see `presenter.rs`
//! for why that gives it access to `Engine`'s private fields.
//!
//! Structured as a small [`LevelShiftPolicy`] trait with exactly one
//! concrete implementation ([`FabricDriftShift`], level 0's fabric drift).
//! Deliberately not generalized further than that: `RealitySnapshot`'s
//! epoch storage and the fixed 40u `FABRIC_DRIFT_CELL` lattice are still
//! level-0-specific, and there is no second consumer yet to prove a more
//! generic shape against. What this buys today is real: the level-0
//! hardcoding becomes a registration instead of an inline guard, so
//! `Engine::tick` no longer needs to know which levels reshape themselves.
